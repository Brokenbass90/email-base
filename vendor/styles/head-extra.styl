// Global head-extra styles.
//
// Purpose:
// - This file is ALWAYS included into <head> (NOT filtered).
// - It ALSO participates in inlining (same rules are applied inline where possible).
//
// Typical use cases:
// - “must be in head” rules that you ALSO want inline.
// - dark-mode / client-specific tweaks that depend on head context.
//
// Keep it minimal.
